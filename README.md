# etched hackathon 2/28

Let's build a personal content search and recommendation system for twitter that is part of the popular open source project called open webui.

Key features:
* Accept user's twitter username and password -> calls browser use to summarize and store tweets every hour into the users database
* present the content to the user and record user's feedback (both implicitly and explicitly)
* use LLMs to analyze the content + user preference
* use the analysis results to perform future recommendation
* modular software architecture for good experimentation of different LLM, different prompting, different algorithms
* open source and make it available to all
